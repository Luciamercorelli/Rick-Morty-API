STEP BY STEP PROJECT ORGANIZATION:
1. Decide the design and all fonts, colors, ecc…
2. Make a list of all the mandatory requirements
3. Create the document where I’ve tracked questions, issues and lesson learned (Notion)
4. Create the project on GitHub (including documentation)
5. Create the project in VS Code using Typescript
6. Create the HTML
7. Create the Typescript/Javascript logic (interfaces, variables, functions)
8. Style the project with CSS
9. Create the presentation
10. Record the video

HOW THE RICK AND MORTY API WORKS:
- On the left side there is the list of the episodes from all seasons, there is a scroll bar that can be used to scroll to the bottom of the list
- If the scroll bar reaches the bottom of the list a "Load more" button will appear and can be clicked to upload more episodes
- Once all the episodes are uploaded the button will disappear
- By clicking on each episode the following information will be displayed:
1.episode info
2.All the characters that appears in the episode
3.Character info
- The episode info contains the following information:
1.Title
2.air date
3.episode reference (season number + episode number)
- The character info contains the following information:
1.Name
2.status
3.species
4.gender

Mandatory requirements (all done):
- Use Type/Interfaces
- Use fetch to make requests
- Use GitHub
- Use Git Commit best practices
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Use Typescript
- Code, comments and documentation written in English
- Use only one HTML file
- Correct configuration of tsconfig.json
- Use enum

Extra requirements:
- Mobile first (done)
- Extra information about the characters (not done)
- Information about the origin location (not done)
- Display the list of episodes in which the character appears (not done)

Issues encountered:
- Understanding the documentation and looking up concepts I didn’t remember
- Understanding the enum concept
- Understanding the type/interface concept
- Working with the API and get the next batch of episodes
- Using Typescript for the first time (issues with type “any”, ecc…)
- Using async functions

Lessons learned:
- Deepen the knowledge of HTML and CSS (mobile first)
- DOM manipulation with Javascript/Typescript
- Injection of HTML into Javascript/Typescript
- First project made with Typescript
- Working with the API and async functions
- Ask for help when I have been stuck
- Effective use of Git
